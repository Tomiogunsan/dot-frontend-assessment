# Project setup

```
run npm install after cloning the repo
npm run dev to start the project

```

```
I used a modal to create and edit a product instead of using a page
```

```
The pagination functionality would have worked better if the data coming from backend include the pageSize field

```
```
if given more time I would have written more test cases
```
